WP Stripe provides a payment form and recent donor widget by utilizing Stripe.com, the awesome alternative to PayPal.

== Description ==

= Introduction =

WP Stripe is a plugin designed to handle **single payments** using [Stripe](http://www.stripe.com/), a refreshing and accessible alternative to PayPal. This is particularly awesome for charities, non-profit organizations and other websites accepting smaller payments where transaction fees are unnecessarily high (no setup or monthly fees either).

= Will it work on my Theme? =

**Yes!** WP-Stripe features an inline form or pop-up modal so that it can fit any theme. There's also a simple option to turn off the default CSS so that you can customize it yourself.

= Features =

This plugin allows you to do a number of things (see screenshots too):

* Add a **Donation/Payment Form** via Shortcode or Template insert
* Add a Widget showing Recent Donations/Payments (using Gravatars)
* View latest Donations/Payments in a Widget (donors can opt-in/opt-out).
* View latest Donations/Payments in a WP-Admin (makes use of custom post types to store transactions without sensitive data, see FAQ for more information).

= Using SSL (Important) =

In order to process transactions in a secure manner, you need to [purchase an SSL Certificate](http://www.noeltock.com/sslcertificates/). This way consumers can purchase/donate with confidence. There are multiple plugins for then enforcing that SSL be used on your page, [here's one](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-https/).

= Stripe Limitations =

Stripe is available in a number of countries, [check here](https://stripe.com/global) to see if your country is supported.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does WP Stripe work ? =

WP Stripe uses a simple to add form to capture person & payment details. Credit card information is then passed to the Stripe servers in the form of a token, increasing security and hindering duplication.

= What information does WP Stripe store? =

WP Stripe **DOES** store basic transaction data (Transaction ID, Amounts & User Data that was voluntarily provided by the donor).

WP Stripe **DOES NOT** store credit card information. Upon form submission, a token is generated by `stripe.js` and passed through POST and then on to the stripe servers, that is the extent of it.

= Does WP Stripe offer a shopping cart module? =

WP Stripe is not intended to be used as an e-commerce solution, but rather to handle single payments and donations.

= Does WP Stripe offer any actions or filters? =

Actions

* `wp_stripe_post_successful_charge` (after a successful charge and saving to WP)
* `wp_stripe_post_fail_charge` (after a failed charge, for whatever reason)

Filter

* `wp_stripe_filter_form`(to filter/edit the content of the form)
