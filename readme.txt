WP Stripe provides a payment form and recent donor widget by utilizing Stripe.com, the awesome alternative to PayPal.

== Description ==

Now works on **any theme**.

WP Stripe is a plugin designed to handle single payments using [Stripe](http://www.stripe.com/), a refreshing and accessible alternative to PayPal. This is particularly awesome for charities, non-profit organizations and other websites accepting smaller payments where transaction fees are unnecessarily high. [Stripe](http://www.stripe.com/) on the other hand charges **2.9% + 30 cents per successful charge**, with no monthly or setup fees.

= Features =

This plugin allows you to do a number of things (see screenshots too):

* Add a **Payment Form** via Shortcode or Template insert
* Add a Widget showing Recent Donations/Payments (using Gravatars)
* View latest Donations/Payments in a Widget (donors can opt-in/opt-out).
* View latest Donations/Payments in a WP-Admin (makes use of custom post types to store transactions without sensitive data, see FAQ for more information).

= Stripe Limitations =

Stripe is currently only available to users accepting payments in the US (i.e. in order to receive money, you must reside in the US), however the payee or cardholder can be anywhere in the world.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does WP Stripe work ? =

WP Stripe uses a simple to add form to capture person & payment details. Credit card information is then passed to the Stripe servers in the form of a token, increasing security and hindering duplication.

= What information does WP Stripe store? =

WP Stripe DOES store basic transaction data (Transaction ID, Amounts & User Data that was voluntarily provided by the donor).

WP Stripe DOES NOT store credit card information. Upon form submission, a token is generated by `stripe.js` and passed through POST and then on to the stripe servers, that is the extent of it.

= Does WP Stripe offer a shopping cart module? =

WP Stripe is not intended to be used as an e-commerce solution, but rather to handle single payments and donations.
